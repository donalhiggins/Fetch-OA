1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
    I chose Python and Pandas because I'm very familiar with using them for data manipulation on .csv files. I knew that sorting the data would be relatively easy
using Pandas and that I could easily read in .csv files and clean the data to manipulate it. 

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
    The advantage of my solution is that it is very easy to read and understand. The disadvantage is that it doesn't directly manipulate the data in the .csv file.
This could also be an advantage though because it doesn't change the original data. If we wanted to update the data after spending the points I could just remove all the rows
that I did not get to spend points on.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
    My favorite personal project so far was the lovebox clone that I made. It was really difficult going into it as I had no experience with hardware and I had to learn that
as I went along but it was also really rewarding to learn about. I also enjoyed the challenge of working on C code that had to be more efficient due to running on an Arduino.
It really made me think a lot about not only how I coded for efficiency in that project but all projects after that. It really opened my eyes to how inefficient so much code is.
